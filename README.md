Evolution of nuclear spins during radical pair dynamics
This project includes various IPython Notebooks made on Google Colab to study the the evolution of nuclear spins invoved in radical pair dynamics.

A. Nuclear Spin Polarization
1. Nuclear_purity.ipynb - Single spin-1/2 HFI.
2. Nuclear_purity_2Spins.ipynb - Two spin-1/2 HFI on same radical.

B. Nuclear-Nuclear Entanglemnt
1. Nuclear_Entanglement.ipynb - One spin-1/2 HFI for each radical.

C. Nuclear-Photon Entanglement
1. Nuclear_Photon_Entanglement.ipynb - Nuclear spin diagonal in x-basis; entanglement basis z-basis.
